<p>as i listen to the soundtrack for a country in a hearts of iron 4 mod which will never release, likely created by someone i used to know but no longer talk to, i start to get the vague feeling like there was something liberatory to the process of creating new world after new world; changing the national boundaries over and over in the same tired manner, but also birthing the consequences of them. its at this moment that im suddenly struck with a ruptorous horror and shockâ€”am i truly becoming nostalgic for hearts of iron 4 modding?</p>

<p>there is something nice about it that i&rsquo;ve been distanced from for a while, about the whole grand strategy perspective, about playing games as a younger child and being creative with others. i was able to project my ideas and feelings about the world into a space where that was entirely expected and iteratively appended. sort of a mutual process of coming into knowing through being repeatedly challenged, not as something political or innate to yourself but just an object you created. playing house with other kids.</p>

<p>the drive of modding was that of basically any form of storytelling, just with different types of parts to move around. there were so many good concepts, now lost to abandoned github repositories, but they were good because they had that internal consistency and internal world that was only unique to map games in the way it was presented. despite being in the genre of &lsquo;alt-history,&rsquo; it was allowed a much greater suspension of disbelief and self-assurity that novels in the same genre often feel they lack, hamfisted in each and every divergence from reality. all fiction is worldbuilding, but the political lens of map games is so rarely communicated as succintly in literature (even though hoi4 isnt a perfect medium for this).</p>

<p>alt-history is also not really a genre of its own. it says nothing really about the story being told, only about the setting which it occurs (though, some kind of political intrigue or war story is usually implied). a balance is required between keeping to the focus of a story and expositing lore about the world it exists in that is, well, difficult. the storytelling mode of games though allows for a ergodic mode of literature, disconnected little blurbs which come to form a world, which i think is uniquely predisposed to allowing this sort of restrained exposition.</p>

<p>the ultimate goal of an alt-hist story, in my eyes, is to recreate essential truths in unique and novel ways, understanding the methods by which history occurs without merely replicating it. it&rsquo;s a very difficult thing, and i don&rsquo;t know if i&rsquo;ve ever done it, only gotten close in moments of elucidation. it&rsquo;s sort of, &ldquo;ah, that <em>would</em> happen, and i didn&rsquo;t even know it before i saw this.&rdquo; it&rsquo;s very hard, though. most people just stick to their cliches, fascist rises to victory, peasant communist revolts, the years 1900-1950 played on loop forever and ever. its tired, and so predominant in the map game space that it was an inspiration for me to do better than them, but i never created a finished product, only concepts, likely because i didnt really understand myself. i still dont, of course, i just know a tiny bit more.</p>

<p>if i am to create another world, it&rsquo;ll be various disconnected stories, and the world will only form from the interconnected actions of all the characters within them. a religious text of sorts.</p>
