&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, Mongol warriors used to cut into their horses and feed on their blood during long travels, so, it&rsquo;s sort of, like&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, so I&rsquo;m just your packhorse now?&rdquo; Kalyna smirked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah—no, I just-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t need to justify it to yourself.&rdquo; Kalyna&rsquo;s eyes pierced into Rana&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hungry, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Kalyna&rsquo;s hands clasped around Rana&rsquo;s, desperately trying to hold their shared bayonet as weakly as possible. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re the only one that can do this. Please, Rana&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside, the pitter-patter of a young spring rain began to fill the empty streets, dripping from collapsed doorway into hardwood divets, eventually coalescing at Rana&rsquo;s knees and soaking through to the collapsed basement below them, percussively hitting the concrete. Grasping at the handle of the blade like it might get away should she let it, she approached the abrased steel to Kalyna&rsquo;s stomach, hesitantly looking to her for affirmation. Kalyna only smiles. Beginning to apply pressure, the blunt knife interacts with her skin like a thumb to an underfilled balloon, made worse by Rana&rsquo;s fearful sluggishness. Her mind races, &ldquo;Do we have any bandages on hand? What if the wound gets infected? What if you pass out? I don&rsquo;t care if you deserve this. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before any of her thoughts externalized themselves, her ability for coherence began to break as her sister&rsquo;s skin gave way, somewhere between tearing and cleaving, red liqueur beading up on the tip of the blade. Kalyna gripped her own palm with an urgency as she desperately tried to suppress her body&rsquo;s involuntary reactions, no longer looking at her sister but at the peeling wallpaper beyond her, her molars digging into her jaw, letting her self-preservation out through a wince and tremor. Fifteen millimeters of steel were now inside her abdomen. Rana&rsquo;s shaking hands began to slice her sister horizontally, though her will faded short of the length she imagined. Rana&rsquo;s lips began to parse a question, but she was in no state to find the words to ask it.</p>

<p>Seeing the pace of the blood exiting Kalyna beginning to increase, Rana quickly and relievedly put the bayonet by her side and, without giving time for doubt, began animalistically feeding on her sister. Blood filled Rana&rsquo;s mouth, swallowing it down with a desperation to avoid leaving it on her tongue for too long, a flavor like salt and tetanus, warm like shower water, it took conscious effort not to gag. Kalyna&rsquo;s body vehemently rejected this even more than the blade, but she could only toss her neck and close her eyes waiting for it to end, wanting desperately to be a good sister, knowing that this was a punishment. As Rana took a moment to breath, Kalyna saw a drop of blood trail down from her lips, staining down to her chin.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">✺✺✺</p>

<p>The liquid at Rana&rsquo;s knees was now a translucent red-pink. As Kalyna covered her laceration with a bandage, things suddenly and dramatically slowed. A sense of quietude enveloped them until, suddenly, rapturously, Kalyna began to laugh. Rana soon joined her.</p>
