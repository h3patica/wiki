<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I go by the name hepatica as a pseudonym online, though I also go by the name krissy on occasion. My pronouns are they/them, and I&rsquo;m currently an undergraduate studying computer science on the Eastern Seaboard.</p>

<p>I like systems and structures and things. I also enjoy truth and the sublime. I write essays and software.</p>

<p>You can find me in a few places:</p>
