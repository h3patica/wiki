<p>i want to write but i&rsquo;ve found some difficulty in finding anything to write /about/ recently, as recently has just been quiet murmurings and vacancy. it doesn&rsquo;t help that i&rsquo;ve felt like i don&rsquo;t really have anywhere to belong since i&rsquo;ve gotten back to college either. my room is no longer my own, it&rsquo;s shared by someone who desires my attention when what i want more than anything is an empty room, exactly to my aesthetic preferences.</p>

<p>it has at least meant i&rsquo;ve been out of my room more. there are many halls that terminate with seating and windows peering out to white-gray ashy horizons. i don&rsquo;t really know what a productive environment for me looks like (which makes me wonder: have i ever been productive?), or if one exists, if instead it&rsquo;s just a manic, fleeting feeling, that i can only either capitalize on or let fall through my fingers, never containable.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;ve just been reading various books. there&rsquo;s so much i want to read. the relative dryness of them is hampering me though, i think (has anyone ever been inspired by baudrillard?). i sort of hate my essay ideas that are all internetful in their reference back to the internet and never really alluding to something greater. i need to get back to /core/ basic realities and ideas, i can&rsquo;t let twitter rot my brain so much that it&rsquo;s the only thing that forms my output. i can transform my manufactured anger into academic slop, but how much is that really worth? is it illuminating? it&rsquo;s just a very effort-intensive way of venting that abstracts away the actual things i&rsquo;m talking about â€” because i can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;what i&rsquo;m really talking about here is this twitter thread that was composed of 40-60% ragebait, as there is now a financial incentive for some users of twitter to make terrible posts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>but i don&rsquo;t really know what truths i, of all people, can illuminate. so i read, and read, waiting for that something to strike me in the head and put me into action. even though i champion writing as one of my few, important hobbies, i&rsquo;m very limited: i rarely write creatively, i don&rsquo;t create poetry or mood pieces generally, i only write in the form of the journal and the essay, and the latter is the one which means &ldquo;true&rdquo; writing in my mind, and it is a cruel type of writing. feelings and emotion have to be pulled out and played with a certain experience and delicateness that isn&rsquo;t present in other types of writing. i want to venture outside of this, not only because it&rsquo;s limiting to me, but because i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good. i want to capture true feeling, not just allude to it. i think in all of my creative writing thus far, the principal theme has been agony. maybe that should change, we&rsquo;ll see, but really it&rsquo;s quite funny thinking back on middle (or high?) school, in which i wrote this long story about slowly dying in a desert, howling in agony, and burying myself in the sand. it was a metaphor for school, or something like that.</p>

<p>i suppose i&rsquo;ll get back to reading. i hope to write soon.</p>
