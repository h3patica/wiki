<p>#ff0000 is a non-regularly published zine project I began in September of 2023. It came about mostly as a result of my own frustration that I had nowhere to really put or display my writings, resigning them to scattered Discord channels or doomed personal websites. I mashed together some things I had written, alongside some pieces of writing I quite admired, and found I had accidentally constructed a theme: sexuality, passion, anger, socialism, and every other thing which red has come to represent. This became the pilot, clocking in at two megabytes and 27 pages. At the time, I was quite happy with how it came out, but looking back on it now it&rsquo;s a little bit embarassingâ€¦</p>

<p>I published the second edition on Valentine&rsquo;s Day 2024, which ended up resembling something I&rsquo;d more likely show others (though there are some parts so honest that I can&rsquo;t help but feel embarassed looking at them). It ended up being forty pages, and I was quite happy to be able to showcase the work of some of my friends and people close to me alongside my own work. I started working on it with only two weeks worth of time, but everyone ended up pulling through in the end, even if I was very much expecting to have to release it later in the month.</p>

<p>The next edition will come out the next time my red is running high, maybe in the summertime or the beginning of my next short-term long-distance relationship, who knows!</p>
