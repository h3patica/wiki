Trees tapped at Kalyna&rsquo;s window as they slowly began to shed their leaves of orange and red, though the moderately noisy hum of her home computer obscured it. A horizon was being reached, slowly but surely, an elucidation only made possible by the exact combination of souls found specifically in Kalyna&rsquo;s chatroom, a smattering of similar wills tugging at the world for purpose and reaching towards their own subjectivity, Californians and Muscovians and Masurians united in collections of beige tech manuals and bespoke software written in Lisp and inner empires pining to destroy themselves. The characters from Kalyna&rsquo;s monitor reflected off of the small collection of gzhel platters forming on her desk, quickly passing by as each line of in-speak was superseded by another. Melting, she could feel her palms naturally drift towards the warm glow, its light pouring out onto her, her body burning up like a space shuttle disaster on re-entry, re-uniting with something sacred and essentially true, until there was no distinction between what was and wasn&rsquo;t hers.</p>

<p>A record scratch from outside her room quickly made Kalyna re-enter her body. Vacuous, drifting voices fill the hall, held together only by the percussive melody of hands gliding up and down piano keys.</p>
