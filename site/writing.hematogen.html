Shifting, groaning, burgeoning; a whisper, a fleeting reminiscence. Clouds of iron oxide plume from corrugated rooves and abandoned machines as winds push themselves through from the shoreline. A constant sunset has descended upon the city, forever red and orange from free-standing rebar and concrete stained with paralyzed spirits, howling still through rotting pipe ecosystems out into the sea. From the murky depths before the shore, where once stood sanitation plants or tenement buildings, thousands of steel arms now reach upwards into the air, a field of metal reeds casting long, taut shadows on the water. The Nadyner slowly drifted in between the stalks, lazily passing through alongside debris-turned-lilypads of algaeic sludge. § &ldquo;That could be the next people! Like a primordial soup&hellip;&rdquo; Rana&rsquo;s words fell on deaf ears as her sister enjoyed a moment of rest in the hold below.   Filled with circuits and glassware and pages of literature and seemingly ancient ephemera, a certain kind of nostalgia aromated from the interior of the Nadyner, like worn leather of a cosmonaut suit and the interior of a beige textbook, with subtle hints of a blind hope — the polycarbonate lens of a computer scientist&rsquo;s glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? It&rsquo;s just like seawater&hellip; and dad, a bit. Nothing hopeful there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; Kalyna thinks for a moment. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a certain kind of aura you get in there. You just know they were hoping for outsized impacts. World-altering stuff. Y&rsquo;know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s barely room in there for one person, it hardly seems like enough for&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who you&rsquo;re talking to?&rdquo; Kalyna flashed her sister a smirk, but Rana could see something behind it—a doubt, a mask of confidence desperately trying to cover a deep-seeded doubt in her actions, or maybe her entire being.</p>

<p>Rana diverts and dismisses. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found anything useful down there, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no food, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking. It&rsquo;s nice to look through the old stuff though, it keeps your mind off the hunger. There&rsquo;s so many letters, and photos&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rana tugs at her sister&rsquo;s sleeve in feigned despair, &ldquo;Aahhhhhh, but I want food Kalyna!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait—and get off me! We&rsquo;re almost at the shore.&rdquo;</p>
