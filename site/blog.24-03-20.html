<p>randomly scraping up against societal norms and getting burnt is more distressing than i would&rsquo;ve thought. i guess it doesn&rsquo;t happen often for me. it seems like as i become more social, i lose the peer-apathy and guardian-fixation of my childhood and slowly have let myself be affected by the thoughts of those around me in a way i typically wouldn&rsquo;t have cared about. it seems generally like as a child, i felt as though i was the only adult, managing an <em>occasionally</em> dysfunctional mother and childish father, believing that maybe i was put into a school for autistic kids and me and everyone else didn&rsquo;t know—which was an incredibly scary thought to me at the time—to now, feeling like a child in the eyes of my guardians and occasionally even my peers. i&rsquo;m still a narcissist but the people around me are gradually gaining more authority over me. i know myself to be &ldquo;morally correct,&rdquo; committing no wrong action unless you truly have the perception of a pentecostal, but societal pressure, fuck. it makes me wanna crawl into a ball for a while in the corner. i wish i could just be with my girlfriend, under the covers, in her arms, comforted, safe, away from the complaints of others.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s a bit of an overreaction. it was what, a few people that i&rsquo;m <em>sort of</em> friends with? it&rsquo;s because i feel such a guttural despair over it though that makes me want to write at all. only three people! i can&rsquo;t imagine what thousands, or tens of thousands, or millions of replies deriding me could be like. it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same, as they wouldn&rsquo;t be my friends, but still.
my will was tested for the first time in years and its like oh, fuck, im a fraud! sorry honey, i can&rsquo;t talk about gutting you tonight, the tenderqueers<sup>†</sup> living in my head wouldn&rsquo;t really like that.</p>

<p>i suppose its also the relative minisculity of social error that i committed. like, if these guys can&rsquo;t handle the placing of an omori character adjacent to a sexual context, then they&rsquo;re REALLY not gonna like what i&rsquo;m doing with my partner. it&rsquo;s a sort of realization that if i was entirely transparent, a good amount of the people around me would <em>hate</em> me. i can&rsquo;t let my opacity lower slightly or i risk getting ousted for disrupting the culture. though, it should also be noted the preoccupation with very silly discourse culture wars rather than things that really ring to a truer disregard for morality. it&rsquo;s not my raceplay or guro posts that get people going—it&rsquo;s the fucking omori and incest ones. it&rsquo;s silly.</p>

<p>hoping that intellectualizing my desires can unshake me a bit. i plan to read some bataille soon in between bouts of manga and other things. he was one of the ones that really Got It. he understood. freud and deleuze and lacan tried but bataille is the only one that gets me. i don&rsquo;t really read for the sake of making my desires seem normal or moral, but it helps me understand myself a bit more, just as learning the term &ldquo;oedipus complex&rdquo; changed my perception of reality; though, that may change again as i read anti-oedipus, who knows. freud is such a cornerstone in my head but some critique would likely be useful.</p>

<p>i come from a long lineage of freaks. my mother writes of rust and blood and snow, plays songs about cutting up your partner in the car; my father puts on the most gratuitously horny shonen for us to watch together and listens to sewerslvt with me later. my actions aren&rsquo;t really an abberation, it&rsquo;s more just a part of my essential nature. i feel bad for the people i give culture shock, but i just hope they can come to understand. i can&rsquo;t be lucky enough that the progression of my life has made me &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; im sorry! i can at least rationalize myself, even if you can barely find reasons that i shouldn&rsquo;t be extrajudicially executed.</p>

<p><sup>†</sup>: a terrible term. i just don&rsquo;t really have anything better to describe the type of person that is the opposite of a &ldquo;traumaqueer.&rdquo;</p>
