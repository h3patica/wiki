<p>hdb, or <em><a href="/site/index.profile.html">hepatica</a> database</em>, is my own small personal wiki for storing information. It&rsquo;s based off of a list of linked files, where each page&rsquo;s &ldquo;children&rdquo; and &ldquo;parents&rdquo; are listed in their filenames, and are navigable at the top of the page. Most of the things you&rsquo;ll find here involve either personal journal-esque writing, or articles that are more intended to be read by others, on topics generally relating to computer science or politics.</p>

<p>The logo for hdb is the alchemical symbol for black sulfur, also known as a Leviathan Cross or Satan&rsquo;s Cross. I think the meaning of the symbol is neat, but really I only use it because it acts as a pretty monogram of hdb (&lsquo;db&rsquo; at the bottom, &lsquo;H&rsquo; along the central line).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to develop a personal wiki for a while, but I&rsquo;d always end up with something more resembling a microblog, even on my second attemptâ€¦ It&rsquo;s very easy to design yourself into a corner if you don&rsquo;t have much of a plan going in. This website seems like it&rsquo;ll be more accommodated to being multifaceted and permanent though.</p>

<p>hdb is written in Go, and its source code can be found <a href="https://git.krissy.club/krissy/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>. Go isn&rsquo;t something I enjoy using much but for tasks like personal-scale webservers, it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way. This site runs off of about 100 lines of server code, which is comparable to my previous PHP blog which was much smaller in scope, and also wasn&rsquo;t concurrent. The code behind this site isn&rsquo;t licensed, so you can use it for any purposes you like. (Though, it also isn&rsquo;t very well documented yet.)</p>
